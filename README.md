# Playing-with-Python
Python Codes
This repository contains all my practice while learning python. So it covers the basics, right upto the functions and making modules.
In the middle of this, I tried using a new system- before begining to write the code, I tried to come up with the solution by writing a pseudo code first in human language :D
It was really helpful. :)
